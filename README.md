#### *Work in Progress*

This library aims to be a high-level abstraction to the APIs of several public transport providers. It's currently nothing more than an idea though and will likely keep on being a playground for quite some time. 

The idea is to implement the core connection handling and response parsing in Rust and write thin FFI-based wrappers around this for other languages. In theory this will hopefully make stuff easier in the long-term.
